                    This is a red blood cell, also known as an Erythrocyte. They transport nutrients and gas throughout the body. They live to around 120 days. The shape of a blood cell allows it to be able to navigate the cardiovascular system easily.

                    This is also a red blood cell. It also transports nutrients and gas throughout the body. However, here's the difference, it only lives to 60 days and has a quite abnormal shape, doesn't it?

                    Due to oxygen being cut off due to blockage caused by the sickle cells, the person feels immense pain and is unable to move for hours, days, sometimes weeks and even months. If you think you can imagine the pain, you can not. Oxygen can be cut off anywhere in the body: legs, brain, heart, lungs, and more. This could lead to death.
